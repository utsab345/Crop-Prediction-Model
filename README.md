# 🌾 Crop Prediction Model 🌾

This project implements a machine learning-based crop prediction system using Flask for web deployment. The model predicts the suitable crop for a given set of agricultural inputs, such as soil characteristics, weather conditions, and other relevant factors.

## 📁 Project Structure

- **app.py**: The main Flask application that serves the web app and handles user input for prediction.
- **model.pkl**: The trained machine learning model saved in pickle format.
- **templates/index.html**: The HTML file containing the form to input data and display predictions.
- **README.md**: This file.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x 🐍
- Flask 🌐
- NumPy 🔢
- Pickle (for model serialization) 📦
- Any dependencies your model needs (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas, etc.) 📊

You can install the required packages by running:

```bash
pip install flask numpy
